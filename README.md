# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Resources
Software: Javascript, HTML, CSS
Repositories: d3, Leaflet, GeoJSON

## Project Overview
  By using MapBox API overlay earthquakes over the last 7 days, and Earth tectonic plates. Data comes from:
  * USGS Hazards Program with a 7 day GeoJson feed of earthquakes
    * https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/
  * Tectonic Plates GeoJson data layer from GitHub user <b>fraxen </b>
    * https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
  
  The USGS Hazards Program earthquake data is overlayed on 3 MapBox layers, and are sized according to magnitude of the earthquake. Additionally, tectonic plates are added to visually explain clustered frequency of earthquakes in areas of the world.
